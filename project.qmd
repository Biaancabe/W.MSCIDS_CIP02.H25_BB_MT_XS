# Introduction and Motivation

ESG performance has become an important factor in corporate strategy and financial markets. Meta-analyses show that a majority of studies find a positive relationship between ESG scores. However, there is also a non-negligible share of research reports that report neutral or even negative effects. [@Friede2015; @WhelanAtzClark2021] Our project focuses on Swiss companies to examine whether ESG scores are positively linked to financial performance.

Our research questions are therefore:
1. What is the relationship between ESG scores and financial performance for Swiss listed companies?
2. What is the effect of the industry type on this relationship, focusing on the top 5 industries in Switzerland.
3. If there is a clear dependency of ESG on financial performance, how do the individual effects of Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G) factors compare in explaining this relationship?
4. How does the relationship between financial performance and research scores behave of Swiss companies compared to peers in the US?

# Data Preparation

```{python}
#| label: load-data
 spi = pd.read_csv("Data/esg_financial_analysis_spi.csv")
sp500 = pd.read_csv("Data/esg_financial_analysis_sp500.csv")
```

```{python}
#| label: SPI-overview
print(spi.shape)
spi.describe()
```

```{python}
#| label: SP500-overview
print(sp500.shape)
sp500.describe()
```
